Practical 2

AIM:Create Android Application to demonstrate functions of Activity Life Cycle and Basic UI.

This Android app demonstrates the Activity Life Cycle by showing Toast or Log messages for methods like onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), etc. It also includes a basic UI with a TextView and Button inside a ConstraintLayout, helping users understand activity states and simple interface design.
